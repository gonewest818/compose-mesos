Similar to the fig-mesos project, this provides the necessary configuration 
to run mesos, marathon and zookeeper as an all-in-one environment on your
local machine. Launch via "docker-compose up"

Inspired by the following
* http://sebgoa.blogspot.com/2015/03/1-command-to-mesos-with-docker-compose.html
* https://hub.docker.com/r/jplock/zookeeper/~/dockerfile/

but lightly modified to use current versions of mesos and marathon from
the Mesosphere official builds.
